This project was developed to contribute to the rapid construction of services. I used the reference of solutions for building microservices.

## Characteristics
* Relational database (SQL Server, PostgreSql and MySql)
* NoSql database (MongoDb and Redis)
* Message Broker (RabbitMQ)
* Pipeline (Pipe and Filters pattern)
* Documentation (Swagger)
* Mapping (AutoMapper)
* Logging
* Standards for data validation (FluentValidation and Data Annotations), specifications (Specification pattern), work unit, repository, among others.

## Examples
You can study different solutions with the Mvp24Hours library. Plus, create quick projects using templates for Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

## Next steps
* Implement request with Consul (Service Discovery) using service key;
* Create project model using Consul (Service Discovery);
* Create project model with ASP.Net Identity;
* Create project model with Grpc over HTTP2 (server and client);
* Implement integration with Kafka (message broker);
* Create project model for gateway (ocelot) with service discovery (consul);
* Create project model for gateway (ocelot) with aggregator;
* Record training videos for the community;

# Steps Completed
* Implement request with HttpFactory to apply resilience concepts;
* Create http log for monitoring exclusive resources;
* Create project model for observability/monitoring application with ElasticSearch (ELK) - distributed log;
* Create project model with dynamic generation of classes with [Mvp24Hours-Entity-T4](https://github.com/kallebelins/mvp24hours-entity-t4);
* Create project model to apply concepts of resilience and fault tolerance;
* Create project model with WatchDog to monitor the health of services;
